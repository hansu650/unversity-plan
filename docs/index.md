## Personal Introduction

This is my personal website. You can call me Minami. I am an undergraduate at Wuhan University, majoring in mathematics. I am particularly interested in abstract algebra, partial differential equations, and deep learning. I am planning to start a startup related to rockets and energy.

## Q&A

- Why English: Our lab is open for everyone and English is the most convinient language to communicate.
- Why Mkdocs: Our notes is written in markdown, so it's easy to publish them in mkdocs.
